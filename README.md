# Halo-MCC-Map-Tools

In early development.

A set of tools to view and modify Halo MCC maps and gamemodes.

Currently only the Forge Map Viewer is available and is only capable of reading the map title and description.

## TODO:

* Identify where the endianness of data is stored
* Identify where the length of the title and description strings are stored.
* Identify where the date-time, original creator, and map id are stored.
* Allow for modification of above data
* Implement hierarchical viewing and editing of forge entities (location, rotation, and other parameters)
